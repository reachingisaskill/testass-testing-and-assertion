 TestAss

Testing and Assertion library.

I wrote a little set of tools to aid the implementation of software unit tests.
Implements useful functions such a floating point comparisons and variable assertions and records 
the results of every comparison.

No formal documentation as yet - please interrogate the header files! Sorry about that...

Arguably I was overusing hash-defines at this point in my programming career - perhaps a different
interface would be good future addition.

Last active development 2015.
